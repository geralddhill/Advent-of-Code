# Day 1 (12/4/23)
This puzzle required me to find the first and last digits from each line of a long sequence, combine the digits to create a two digit number, and add all of the two digit numbers together. The first part only required my to do it with literal digits, but the second part proved more complex, requiring me to include digits writted out as words (ex: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc). This would have been relatively easy: all I had to do was learn the basics of regional expressions (or regexp), but there was an exception on input line 110, where towards the end, the line contained the string 'oneight'. This is supposed to read 8 as the last digit, but my initial solution read 1. This problem was very hard to solve, and I even peaked at some solutions, which all seemed very different from mine. I fiddled around in a regexp generator enough and found a solution using something called "negative lookahed" to check if there was a combonation of two words like "oneight," made that one return the back word instead of the front, and made a second regexp just for finding the back/last number in the line.
